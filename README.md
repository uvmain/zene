## Installation
- create a `.env` file using `.env.example` as a guide
- copy the `docker-compose.yml` file into the same directory, and update the mount points as required
- `docker compose up -d` to pull the image and run the container in the background

### example
> .env
```
BASE_URL=https://zene.domain.tld
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=supersecretpassword
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@localhost
AUDIO_CACHE_MAX_DAYS=30
AUDIO_CACHE_MAX_MB=500
```
> docker-compose.yml
```
services:
  zene:
    image: uvmain/zene:latest
    container_name: zene
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./local-data-dir:/data
      - /mnt/Music:/music:ro
    ports:
      - 3020:8080
```

### Tech stack
- `Sqlite` database
- `Go` backend
- `Vue` frontend (embedded during build)

- uses `Air` and `Vite` for HMR, and `Caddy` for SSL in local development

## localdev
### requirements
- Go v1.25+
- Node 22+

### install dependencies
First install npm dependencies (this will install the frontend workspace and the Caddy localdev utility)
```bash
npm i
```
Then install the Golang requirements
```bash
npm run setup
```

resolving Caddy cert issues on debian/ubuntu
- Ensure libnss3-tools is installed
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libnss3-tools
  ```
- Enable port-binding for the caddy binary
  ```bash
  sudo setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip node_modules/caddy-baron/caddy
  ```
- If you still get an ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID error, run:
  ```bash
  certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "C,," -n "Caddy Local Authority" -i ~/.local/share/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt
  ```
